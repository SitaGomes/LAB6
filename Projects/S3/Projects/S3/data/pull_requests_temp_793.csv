Description

The Open Weather Map API was not serving over HTTPS, leading to mixed content issues, since geolocation requires HTTPS. Forecast.io's API is also free, requires sign up, but up to 1k hits per day w/ no charge or card on file.
I'm (unsurprisingly) not the first person to notice this. Seems to intersect w/ #7853 and #9145, the latter I believe it closes, at least accounts for it from the documentation side of things (as the currently recommended open weather map API leads to a funny experience, at least for Chrome users).",1,1,1,{'totalCount': 17},{'totalCount': 7},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'freeCodeCamp', 'name': 'freeCodeCamp'}",1134.683611111111

Description

I've started contributing to FreeCodeCamp about a week ago. When I started contributing, I also joined the Contributors chat room. From my own experience and the experience of many other new contributors, I've found there's an issue in the npm run only-once command. \n on Windows doesn't add a new line. In fact, it's even worse. In the script, it seems to break. This pull request removes the new lines. I realize that this does make these little messages harder to catch. I think the trade-off is worth it, though. Because there is no new output for a while after the first message, and the last message is the very last thing logged, they're still hard to miss. I did some research on getting newlines in the command line on Windows, but there doesn't seem to be an easy cross-platform solution.
I hope this will help out new contributors, taking one more bump out of the road of contributing to a large open source project. 🔥",1,1,1,{'totalCount': 8},{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'freeCodeCamp', 'name': 'freeCodeCamp'}",69.93555555555555

Information Retrieval and Web Search is a field which involves finding relevant information for a given query, be it for as simple as a database search, or as complicated as a web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). There has been renewed interest in this field, thanks to Deep Learning and Vector Space Modeling. Finding content that is both relevant to the user, and has high topic relevance is the key point of research in this field. However, many don't know about the different resources available at out disposal. It would be a good idea to have a list of Awesome Information Retrieval and Web Search, for people to discover resources and make this field even more awesome.

./README-ja.md:RPCは振る舞いを公開することに焦点を当てています。RPCは内部通信パフォーマンスを理由として使われることが多いです。というのも、使用する状況に合わせてネーティブコールを自作することができるからです。

An OpenStack project that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run.
The name (Python Build Reasonableness) describes it well. It makes your setuptools config declarative, manages versioning via git tags, generates AUTHORS and CHANGELOG files from git log, picks up requirements.txt as dependencies, etc.
Very useful as a one-stop solution to packaging-related things; an alternative to combining multiple other projects (such as setuptools_scm + sh scripts interfacing with git + ...).

PyPattyrn is a python package aiming to make it easier and faster to implement design patterns into your own projects. Containing over 15 of the most common design patterns, you no longer have to write the same boilerplate code between all your projects when you wish to use a design pattern. This package captures that boilerplate code and makes it easy to use.
Example:
from pypattyrn.creational.singleton import Singleton

class DummyClass(object, metaclass=Singleton):
    ... 
DummyClass is now a Singleton.
What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?
Every other design pattern repo I've found simply provides examples for how to implement design patterns in python. PyPattyrn is something you would actually import into your project to speed up development process because the boilerplate code necessary for the design pattern is already written and provided for you by the package. I have not found another package that does the same thing.

What is this Python project?
Surprise is a Python scikit building and analysing recommender systems.
Main features:

Give the user perfect control over his experiments. To this end, a strong  emphasis is laid on   documentation, which we  have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every  details of the algorithms.
Alleviate the pain of Dataset  handling.   Users can use both built-in datasets
(Movielens,  Jester), and their own custom  datasets.
Provide various ready-to-use prediction  algorithms  such as baseline  algorithms,  neighborhood  methods, matrix  factorization-based (  SVD,  PMF,  SVD++,  NMF),  and many  others.  Also, various similarity
measures  (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
Make it easy to implement new algorithm  ideas.
Provide tools to evaluate,  analyse  and  compare  the algorithms performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very  easily, as well as exhaustive search over a set of  parameters.

What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

According to any google search, crab is the go-to package for RS. But it actually only has one prediction algorithm (k-NN), no evaluation tools, no doc, and has been dead for three years.
The second most popular package I think is Recsys. Provides with two prediction algorithms (k-NN and SVD) but is also unmaintained. Evaluation tools are very minimal.
There's GraphLab, which is not free and needs license registration. I've heard good feedback about it, but never used it.
LightFM. This package is focused on a specific set of algorithms (all Boolean-valued) and does not provide with other classical approaches.

I think what makes Surprise is it's doc, the variety of prediction algorithms and the ability to evaluate the performances of algorithms easily (cross-validation, GridSearch, etc.). This makes it a useful tool to get your hands dirty quickly with recommender systems.

An advanced task flow management on top of famous Celery project (a distributed task queue). It allows one to create advanced task flows by creating YAML configuration files which state dependencies between tasks, fallback tasks (run on task failures) or run whole flows (transitively or even recursively). Dependencies between tasks or flows are graphs (without any limitation to DAG). It also enables one to use different storage or database adapters or running only certain tasks in a flow definition - system will automatically compute dependencies between tasks (which tasks needs to be run in order to run desired tasks). Selinon comes with a set of prepared storage/database adapters and support for tracing system actions (easy to integrate with Sentry or other monitoring systems) or logging ELK (Elasticsearch, logstash, Kibana) stack to provide ready-to-be-used system in clusters (using Kubernetes, OpenShift or others). A built in simutor can run your flows by executing CLI.

994,CLOSED,2017-12-29T11:30:19Z,,2019-11-06T11:36:38Z,Remove links to Python design patterns repository,"Replace with link to video showing why many patterns are unnecessary.
In my opinion, the linked repos (python-patterns and PyPatterns) are really unhelpful ways of thinking about patterns in Python - they are anti-patterns in Python, and not something that should be promoted.
Basically, most of the patterns popular in Java world are ""invisible or simpler"" in dynamic languages like Python (according to Peter Norvig - http://www.norvig.com/design-patterns/ ). This is due to:

the pattern being built in (e.g. iterator)
various language features, especially:

first class functions (command, strategy,
template-method, visitor)
first class types (factory, abstract factory, flyweight, factory method, state, proxy, chain-of-responsibility)



Of the two links, PyPatterns is the worst, and actually encourages importing a library to get functionality that only increases the amount of code you have to write. I see that it was added because someone wanted something they could actually import. However, this comes from people thinking in Java - but Python is not Java without the compile. There is negative value in using this kind of repo - Python makes the pattern invisible or simpler, by adding an import and base classes you have only made life hard for yourself.
For example, Factory and Abstract Factory pattern:
https://github.com/tylerlaberge/PyPattyrn#factory-pattern
https://github.com/faif/python-patterns/blob/master/creational/abstract_factory.py
Once you understand that Python has first class types, these become totally pointless.
Here is a class in Python:
class A:
    pass

And here is a factory for it:
A

(A is it's own factory - when you call it, it produces an object of type A. There is no new keyword in Python.)
And here is a factory that you can assign to a variable, or pass as an argument to a function/method:
A

(First class types.)
And here is a factory if you wanted to create A in a non-default way:
lambda:  A(some_parameter=123)

Or, in a builtin-standard-but-non-default way
class A:
    def __init__(self, enabled=True)
        self.enabled = enabled

    @classmethod
    def create_disabled(cls):
        return cls(enabled=False)

# Factory callable you can pass around:
A.create_disabled

These are the idiomatic ways to do these things. If you are writing anything more than that, you are doing it wrong.
Even when the pattern is bigger than invisible, its implementation is often massively simpler in Python. The linked repositories often use classes with no state and a single method. This is pointless - we should be deleting such classes and replacing them a single callable - see Stop Writing Classes
PyPatterns even includes an implementation of iterator and iterable - when these are built in to Python!
I was going to submit PRs to the linked repositories, but most of the PRs would involve deleting 90% of the code, which is unlikely to be accepted, I thought it better to submit this PR first.",1,2,2,{'totalCount': 3},{'totalCount': 3},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'vinta', 'name': 'awesome-python'}",16248.105277777779

Snips NLU has been designed to run very fast, with a very low memory footprint, while achieving very good prediction accuracy (cf this blogpost).
This library offers an interface with snips-nlu-rs, its Rust equivalent for inference only. It allows to persist the NLU pipeline trained with the python code, and load it with the rust code to perform inference. This offers a great portability.

6914,CLOSED,2016-05-28T22:37:05Z,,2017-03-01T21:34:04Z,"Add React.PureComponent, inherit purity for functional components","React.PureComponent
This provides an easy way to indicate that components should only rerender when given new props, like PureRenderMixin. If you rely on mutation in your React components, you can continue to use React.Component.
Inheriting from React.PureComponent indicates to React that your component doesn't need to rerender when the props are unchanged. We'll compare the old and new props before each render and short-circuit if they're unchanged. It's like an automatic shouldComponentUpdate, but it also affects the behavior of functional children that are rendered:
Functional components
We've heard clearly that most React users intend for their functional components to be pure and to produce different output only if the component's props have changed (https://mobile.twitter.com/reactjs/status/736412808372314114). However, a significant fraction of users still rely on mutation in their apps; when used with mutation, comparing props on each render could lead to components not updating even when the data is changed.
Therefore, we're changing functional components to behave as pure when they're used inside a React.PureComponent but to rerender unconditionally when contained in a React.Component:
class Post extends React.PureComponent {  // or React.Component
  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""post"">
        <PostHeader model={this.props.model} />
        <PostBody model={this.props.model} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

function PostHeader(props) {
  // ...
}

function PostBody(props) {
  // ...
}
In this example, the functional components PostHeader and PostBody will be treated as pure because they're rendered by a pure parent component (Post). If our app used mutable models instead, Post should extend React.Component, which would cause PostHeader and PostBody to rerender whenever Post does, even if the model object is the same.
We anticipate that this behavior will work well in real-world apps: if you use immutable data, your class-based components can extend React.PureComponent and your functional components will be pure too; if you use mutable data, your class-based components will extend React.Component and your functional components will update accordingly.
In the future, we might adjust these heuristics to improve performance. For example, we might do runtime detection of components like
function FancyButton(props) {
  return <Button style=""fancy"" text={props.text} />;
}
and optimize them to ""inline"" the child Button component and call it immediately, so that React doesn't need to store the props for Button nor allocate a backing instance for it -- causing less work to be performed and reducing GC pressure.",14,382,64,{'totalCount': 91},{'totalCount': 21},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'facebook', 'name': 'react'}",6646.949722222223

Firstly I moved all our non-top-level requires to the top level and __DEV__ on their usage (we only have 5 files that have that). Since we no longer have dynamic parts in our require/exports, they are pretty much ES6-compliant. Then there's a Babel pass for Rollup to firstly rewrite all require/exports to ES6 import/exports, and finally it bundles to a flat file (in UMD format). It sounds weird to transpile files from ES5 to ES6 but using this babel pass results in smaller file sizes comparing with using Rollup's CommonJS plugin.
This decreases our gzipped minified (prod) file size by ~10% and some of the benchmarks look pretty good.

This is a resubmission of pull request #6459. Just to recap...
The addition of the unsupported property warning (#6800) reminded my old PR (#6459) and I was curious about reopening it... So here we are.
This pull request configures DOMPropertyOperations to allow all attributes to pass through. It maintains the whitelist only for attributes that need special behavior, such as boolean props and name translations (like className).
While I was at it, I also eliminated the duplicated list of ""reserved props"" between ReactDOMUnknownPropertyDevtool and ReactDOMComponent through a new isReservedProp method on DOMProperty.

Introducing the React Release Manager, built to replace all of the manual steps involved in maintaining & shipping React.
Primary focus so far has been the most time-intensive & error prone steps. But automating more of this process is super important as we want to be able to turn around releases much more quickly, and ensure more people feel confident doing it (I've run almost every release since we started)
Quick overview:

docs-prs: replaces a GH label search, opening a bunch of tabs, copying the merge sha, cherry-pick each of those, push, batch remove label on GH
stable-prs: similar docs process but with milestones
version: replaces manually editing a bunch of files before release (or other similar steps, eventually became me using patch)
npm-publish: replaces a couple commands in my shell history, or a fancy ls build/packages/*.tgz | xargs -n1 npm publish

Plans:

publish: do the whole thing
version-start: create/update branches for release prep work (eg, just shipped 15.3.0, make sure dev branch exists)
changelog: generate a naive version of the changelog from X to Y (maybe just added to stable-prs command)
a whole bunch of refinement and error handling, state checking (eg, don't try to do anything if git state is dirty or on the wrong branch)",17,1199,0,{'totalCount': 0},{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'facebook', 'name': 'react'}",4046.5558333333333

More cases (and what fixes look like) here: #7253 (comment)
Issues with uncontrolled inputs
This is because assigning defaultValue causes side-effects on value. It seems to trigger validation on value as if it were directly assigned itself.
This Codepen provides a step by step reproduction case:
http://codepen.io/nhunzaker/pen/zBaokp

This PR wraps the defaultValue assignment in a conditional so that it will only ever be assigned if the defaultValue has changed.
Issues with controlled inputs
It looks like the issue here is that value is being assigned using the standard React method of updating attributes when the props get passed in here:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponent.js#L926
There is some logic in ReactDOMInput to prevent duplicate values from being assigned here:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/wrappers/ReactDOMInput.js#L201-L210
Unfortunately the new value has already been assigned.
This PR adds a check for the value prop, and only assigns it if is different. It never assigns the value attribute if it hasn't changed:
I don't really know why this works. I didn't think node.setAttribute('value', value) was meaningful. What do you think?

This is a reimplementation of #7359 that additionally eliminates much of the work done inside of ReactDOMInput to handle quirks associated with defaultValue, value, defaultChecked, and checked.
It does this by ensuring a specific order for property assignment on the input element. This is implemented within DOMProperty and HTMLDOMPropertyConfig, which may allow for other elements to eventually take advantage of it (should they need it).
Performance changes
Since they do less work, controlled inputs are slightly faster, while non-ordered HTML tags have no observable performance regression (in my ability to test, anyway).
Fixes from the original PR
This is a major deviation from my solution in #7359, but it includes the same input fixes. These are enumerated in #7253 (comment). Basically, since the mutation method for value first checks to see if the property is loosely the same, it eliminates many edge cases with controlled number inputs, like:

Controlled and uncontrolled numbers won't drop off decimal places when backspacing, like converting 3. to 3
Controlled numbers that use parseFloat or parseInt won't ""expand"" values, like magically replace 3e1 with 30.

Other fixes
Some fixes are no longer necessary inside of ReactDOMInput:

Assigning type and step before value for IE11
Properly ordering defaultValue/value for inputs to ensure date inputs display properly on Android and iOS.
Ensure defaultChecked does not influence checked in Chrome 50.x

x = ReactTestRenderer.create(<a />);

div = ReactTestRenderer.create(<div><a /></div>);
x = div.getChildren()[0];
div.update(<div><b /></div>);
x.getType();

then since x points directly to the original <a /> child, there's no possible way we could return 'b'. So rather than have a confusing inconsistency between the top-level node and all the lower ones, @gaearon suggested outlawing changing type and key so that you always have the same instance.
I'm not actually sure I like this. It might make more sense to distinguish between the top-level instance and the children in the API -- since it also makes sense to call .update and .unmount at the top but nowhere else.

@philipshurpik, if you meant to keep on working on #6940, please let me know and I'll close this one.
The idea is to return a PropTypeError whenever one of ReactPropTypes is passed to ReactPropTypes.oneOf. The error message, hints that the user might be meaning to use ReactPropTypes.oneOfType instead.

If createChainableTypeChecker is called with an expectedType we add the expectedType flag to the checkType function (see [1])
In createEnumTypeChecker.validate, if expectedValues[i] is of type function and it has the expectedType flag, we know that a ReactPropTypes has been passed, so we throw the error described above
As per #6940, if a generic function is passed to ReactPropTypes.oneOf we improve the previous output to display ""Unexpected function"" and the function converted to string

As a side note, I noticed that if getPropType is called with undefined, we get the following exception:
Cannot read property '@@toStringTag' of undefined
Is this expected?

I want to stress that this is a short-term solution. It works and the reasoning is sound but I'm not happy that we need this. It's probably time to start using webpack to bundle but that would have taken me much longer to go do.
Byte-wise this should be fine. We're just adding the code that you can see in there. Since we do this after the bundle process is done, that require('react') isn't analyzed.
Todo:

 Look for any other expected globals in shims
 Use this in other bundles
 Look into the RequireJS situation. I honestly don't care much about that but we should probably make it work. It would require rejiggering the wrapper (since we couldn't execute the UMDed module immediately)

Made a hello world app with webpack and aliased react and react-dom.

3710,CLOSED,2016-09-20T20:00:18Z,,2016-10-12T04:56:07Z,Allow for function as child,"Function as a child is a very powerful pattern employed in react.  It allows the consumer of a component to choose how to render a component, while having access to data passed down by the parent.
It is similar to slots, in a way, except slots only gain you access to the data in the hosting component.
For more information on the possibilities that this pattern enables, please see this blog post, this presentation from Ryan Florence at React Rally, as well as the new API for React Router 4.0.
Before I go on, I do want to say that the pattern is achievable right now using props:
It is possible now to mimic this using props with the following pattern:
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    props: ['render'],
    render (h) {
       return this.render('Hello, World');
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData render={data => <span>{data}</span>}></ComponentWithData>
    }
})

However, ""first-class"" support would be nice.
As far as the vue flavor, the API looks like this:
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    render (h) {
       return this.$slots.default('Hello, World')
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData>{data => <span>{data}</span>}</ComponentWithData>
    }
})

A couple of things:

In my implementation, if an array is passed for children, and any of the children are a function, that will throw away all children, except for the function

The basic idea here is, skip checking async component when hydration. To support this, I introduced a new flag on VNode isAsyncPlaceholder. A placeholder VNode is same as an emptyVNode, except the new flag set to true. Before this commit, an async component will be rendered to emptyVNode(in createElement). After this commit, an async component will be rendered to placeholderVNode. So the behavior in client-side rendering or bailed SSR rendering should be kept.
In SSR hydration, we skip checking a placeholder VNode against a real element. After component is resolved, the Vue instance in question will $forceUpdate in callback. So even if the real element dismatches with resolved VNode, rendered dom structure should be up to date.
Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because isHydrating is not available in createComponent.
Another potential problem is that third party code can attach event handler / store data on SSR element. Those information will be lost in $forceUpdate callback.

I am working on integration of Vue with Meteor and I would like that Vue could be a drop-in replacement for Blaze. That is almost possible, because architecture is very similar. Vue is also using reactive dependency tracking, observer, while Meteor/Blaze is using Tracker. Now, there is a lot of code written for Meteor which is using Tracker and it would be great if it could just work with Vue. And in fact it is doable. I managed to create a full 100% compatible Tracker implementation on top of Vue's observer. But there are some changes necessary to observer's implementation and some internals have to be exposed.
This pull request is initial version of changes I had to do to get this first version of Tracker implemented, to get discussion rolling. I would really like to see if this or something like this could get merged into Vue. From my perspective changes do not really change how observer is working, and all existing tests are still passing.
A list of changes:

added support for after flush callbacks
adding a way to force flushing
fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget
correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter
exposing some internals (probably too much, API could be cleaner there)

Requesting comments, feedback, suggestions. This is work in progress. I will add tests in the future, after we finalize that this is OK to do and everything else.

This is a PR to add TypeScript definition files for Vue.js 1.x into this repository.
Since Vue decided to bundle its definition files, they were hosted on DefinitelyTyped.

DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13230
DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13235
DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13236

However, as these PRs imply, vue.d.ts was removed and currently there's no way to manage the 1.x's one.
In addition, there were a lot of changes between 2.x's and 1.x's definition, such as vuejs namespace, plural or singular. So I changed its content in order to allow users to use what version they like with TypeScript.
Of course, the past definitions were written for TS 1.x, but this one is for TS 2.x.

[  581.465203] i2c_hid i2c-ELAN1200:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (16/65535)
Also there were the next bugs:

If you touch touchpad with 5 fingers, the driver dies immediately.
When you scroll anything, and release one finger, driver thought you are still scrolling

Recently, I spoke to ELANTECH and they send me a patch suggested by Intel to fix this issue. It was a simple hack, so me and guys from redhat forum created this patch.
It is fixed by adding additional quirk to trigger IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING flag.
An explanation about why i2c_hid_init_irq section was moved under the i2c_hid_lookup_quirk, answered by Hans de Goede hdegoede@redhat.com:

i2c_hid_init_irq now checks for a quirk, so we must setup the quirks before we init the irq, and we cannot setup the quirk earlier, so we must init the irq later.

So this commit revert's this commit, as no message flood can be seen by now, and fixes touchpad problems.

Changelog
Sourced from pip's changelog.

23.3 (2023-10-15)
Process

Added reference to vulnerability reporting guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/security/>_ to pip's security policy.

Deprecations and Removals

Drop a fallback to using SecureTransport on macOS. It was useful when pip detected OpenSSL older than 1.0.1, but the current pip does not support any Python version supporting such old OpenSSL versions. ([#12175](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12175) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12175>_)

Features

Improve extras resolution for multiple constraints on same base package. ([#11924](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924>_)
Improve use of datastructures to make candidate selection 1.6x faster. ([#12204](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12204) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12204>_)
Allow pip install --dry-run to use platform and ABI overriding options. ([#12215](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12215) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12215>_)
Add is_yanked boolean entry to the installation report (--report) to indicate whether the requirement was yanked from the index, but was still selected by pip conform to :pep:592. ([#12224](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12224) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12224>_)

Bug Fixes

Ignore errors in temporary directory cleanup (show a warning instead). ([#11394](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394>_)
Normalize extras according to :pep:685 from package metadata in the resolver
for comparison. This ensures extras are correctly compared and merged as long
as the package providing the extra(s) is built with values normalized according

The function blk_mq_virtio_map_queues currently assumes that the number of available interrupt vectors in the virtio device is equal to or greater than the number of queues. However, this assumption may not always hold true, especially in scenarios where the number of vectors is less than the number of queues.
This patch enhances blk_mq_virtio_map_queues to support dynamic allocation of interrupt vectors. If the number of available vectors is less than the number of queues, the function now dynamically allocates vectors and assigns queues accordingly.
This enhancement ensures better compatibility and scalability for systems with virtio devices where the number of vectors may be limited.

Release notes
Sourced from urllib3's releases.

2.2.2
🚀 urllib3 is fundraising for HTTP/2 support
urllib3 is raising ~$40,000 USD to release HTTP/2 support and ensure long-term sustainable maintenance of the project after a sharp decline in financial support for 2023. If your company or organization uses Python and would benefit from HTTP/2 support in Requests, pip, cloud SDKs, and thousands of other projects please consider contributing financially to ensure HTTP/2 support is developed sustainably and maintained for the long-haul.
Thank you for your support.
Changes

Added the Proxy-Authorization header to the list of headers to strip from requests when redirecting to a different host. As before, different headers can be set via Retry.remove_headers_on_redirect.
Allowed passing negative integers as amt to read methods of http.client.HTTPResponse as an alternative to None. (#3122)
Fixed return types representing copying actions to use typing.Self. (#3363)

Thank you for your support.
Changes

Fixed issue where InsecureRequestWarning was emitted for HTTPS connections when using Emscripten. (#3331)
Fixed HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen to stop automatically casting non-proxy headers to HTTPHeaderDict. This change was premature as it did not apply to proxy headers and HTTPHeaderDict does not handle byte header values correctly yet. (#3343)
Changed ProtocolError to InvalidChunkLength when response terminates before the chunk length is sent. (#2860)
Changed ProtocolError to be more verbose on incomplete reads with excess content. (#3261)

2.2.0
🖥️ urllib3 now works in the browser
🎉 This release adds experimental support for using urllib3 in the browser with Pyodide! 🎉
Thanks to Joe Marshall (@​joemarshall) for contributing this feature. This change was possible thanks to work done in urllib3 v2.0 to detach our API from http.client. Please report all bugs to the urllib3 issue tracker.

Fixed issue where requests against urls with trailing dots were failing due to SSL errors
when using proxy. (#2244)
