Description

The Open Weather Map API was not serving over HTTPS, leading to mixed content issues, since geolocation requires HTTPS. Forecast.io's API is also free, requires sign up, but up to 1k hits per day w/ no charge or card on file.
I'm (unsurprisingly) not the first person to notice this. Seems to intersect w/ #7853 and #9145, the latter I believe it closes, at least accounts for it from the documentation side of things (as the currently recommended open weather map API leads to a funny experience, at least for Chrome users).",1,1,1,{'totalCount': 17},{'totalCount': 7},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'freeCodeCamp', 'name': 'freeCodeCamp'}",1134.683611111111

Description

I've started contributing to FreeCodeCamp about a week ago. When I started contributing, I also joined the Contributors chat room. From my own experience and the experience of many other new contributors, I've found there's an issue in the npm run only-once command. \n on Windows doesn't add a new line. In fact, it's even worse. In the script, it seems to break. This pull request removes the new lines. I realize that this does make these little messages harder to catch. I think the trade-off is worth it, though. Because there is no new output for a while after the first message, and the last message is the very last thing logged, they're still hard to miss. I did some research on getting newlines in the command line on Windows, but there doesn't seem to be an easy cross-platform solution.
I hope this will help out new contributors, taking one more bump out of the road of contributing to a large open source project. 🔥",1,1,1,{'totalCount': 8},{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'freeCodeCamp', 'name': 'freeCodeCamp'}",69.93555555555555
