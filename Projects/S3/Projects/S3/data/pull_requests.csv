An OpenStack project that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run.
The name (Python Build Reasonableness) describes it well. It makes your setuptools config declarative, manages versioning via git tags, generates AUTHORS and CHANGELOG files from git log, picks up requirements.txt as dependencies, etc.
Very useful as a one-stop solution to packaging-related things; an alternative to combining multiple other projects (such as setuptools_scm + sh scripts interfacing with git + ...).

PyPattyrn is a python package aiming to make it easier and faster to implement design patterns into your own projects. Containing over 15 of the most common design patterns, you no longer have to write the same boilerplate code between all your projects when you wish to use a design pattern. This package captures that boilerplate code and makes it easy to use.
Example:
from pypattyrn.creational.singleton import Singleton

class DummyClass(object, metaclass=Singleton):
    ... 
DummyClass is now a Singleton.
What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?
Every other design pattern repo I've found simply provides examples for how to implement design patterns in python. PyPattyrn is something you would actually import into your project to speed up development process because the boilerplate code necessary for the design pattern is already written and provided for you by the package. I have not found another package that does the same thing.

What is this Python project?
Surprise is a Python scikit building and analysing recommender systems.
Main features:

Give the user perfect control over his experiments. To this end, a strong  emphasis is laid on   documentation, which we  have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every  details of the algorithms.
Alleviate the pain of Dataset  handling.   Users can use both built-in datasets
(Movielens,  Jester), and their own custom  datasets.
Provide various ready-to-use prediction  algorithms  such as baseline  algorithms,  neighborhood  methods, matrix  factorization-based (  SVD,  PMF,  SVD++,  NMF),  and many  others.  Also, various similarity
measures  (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
Make it easy to implement new algorithm  ideas.
Provide tools to evaluate,  analyse  and  compare  the algorithms performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very  easily, as well as exhaustive search over a set of  parameters.

What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

According to any google search, crab is the go-to package for RS. But it actually only has one prediction algorithm (k-NN), no evaluation tools, no doc, and has been dead for three years.
The second most popular package I think is Recsys. Provides with two prediction algorithms (k-NN and SVD) but is also unmaintained. Evaluation tools are very minimal.
There's GraphLab, which is not free and needs license registration. I've heard good feedback about it, but never used it.
LightFM. This package is focused on a specific set of algorithms (all Boolean-valued) and does not provide with other classical approaches.

I think what makes Surprise is it's doc, the variety of prediction algorithms and the ability to evaluate the performances of algorithms easily (cross-validation, GridSearch, etc.). This makes it a useful tool to get your hands dirty quickly with recommender systems.

An advanced task flow management on top of famous Celery project (a distributed task queue). It allows one to create advanced task flows by creating YAML configuration files which state dependencies between tasks, fallback tasks (run on task failures) or run whole flows (transitively or even recursively). Dependencies between tasks or flows are graphs (without any limitation to DAG). It also enables one to use different storage or database adapters or running only certain tasks in a flow definition - system will automatically compute dependencies between tasks (which tasks needs to be run in order to run desired tasks). Selinon comes with a set of prepared storage/database adapters and support for tracing system actions (easy to integrate with Sentry or other monitoring systems) or logging ELK (Elasticsearch, logstash, Kibana) stack to provide ready-to-be-used system in clusters (using Kubernetes, OpenShift or others). A built in simutor can run your flows by executing CLI.

994,CLOSED,2017-12-29T11:30:19Z,,2019-11-06T11:36:38Z,Remove links to Python design patterns repository,"Replace with link to video showing why many patterns are unnecessary.
In my opinion, the linked repos (python-patterns and PyPatterns) are really unhelpful ways of thinking about patterns in Python - they are anti-patterns in Python, and not something that should be promoted.
Basically, most of the patterns popular in Java world are ""invisible or simpler"" in dynamic languages like Python (according to Peter Norvig - http://www.norvig.com/design-patterns/ ). This is due to:

the pattern being built in (e.g. iterator)
various language features, especially:

first class functions (command, strategy,
template-method, visitor)
first class types (factory, abstract factory, flyweight, factory method, state, proxy, chain-of-responsibility)



Of the two links, PyPatterns is the worst, and actually encourages importing a library to get functionality that only increases the amount of code you have to write. I see that it was added because someone wanted something they could actually import. However, this comes from people thinking in Java - but Python is not Java without the compile. There is negative value in using this kind of repo - Python makes the pattern invisible or simpler, by adding an import and base classes you have only made life hard for yourself.
For example, Factory and Abstract Factory pattern:
https://github.com/tylerlaberge/PyPattyrn#factory-pattern
https://github.com/faif/python-patterns/blob/master/creational/abstract_factory.py
Once you understand that Python has first class types, these become totally pointless.
Here is a class in Python:
class A:
    pass

And here is a factory for it:
A

(A is it's own factory - when you call it, it produces an object of type A. There is no new keyword in Python.)
And here is a factory that you can assign to a variable, or pass as an argument to a function/method:
A

(First class types.)
And here is a factory if you wanted to create A in a non-default way:
lambda:  A(some_parameter=123)

Or, in a builtin-standard-but-non-default way
class A:
    def __init__(self, enabled=True)
        self.enabled = enabled

    @classmethod
    def create_disabled(cls):
        return cls(enabled=False)

# Factory callable you can pass around:
A.create_disabled

These are the idiomatic ways to do these things. If you are writing anything more than that, you are doing it wrong.
Even when the pattern is bigger than invisible, its implementation is often massively simpler in Python. The linked repositories often use classes with no state and a single method. This is pointless - we should be deleting such classes and replacing them a single callable - see Stop Writing Classes
PyPatterns even includes an implementation of iterator and iterable - when these are built in to Python!
I was going to submit PRs to the linked repositories, but most of the PRs would involve deleting 90% of the code, which is unlikely to be accepted, I thought it better to submit this PR first.",1,2,2,{'totalCount': 3},{'totalCount': 3},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'vinta', 'name': 'awesome-python'}",16248.105277777779

Finding content that is both relevant to the user, and has high topic relevance is the key point of research in this field. However, many don't know about the different resources available at out disposal.

By submitting this pull request I confirm I've read and complied with the below requirements.
Failure to properly do so will just result in the pull request being closed and everyone's time wasted. Please read it twice. Most people miss many things.

 I have read and understood the contribution guidelines and the instructions for creating a list.
 This pull request has a descriptive title. For example, Add Name of List, not Update readme.md or Add awesome list.
 The entry in the Awesome list should include a short description about the list project/theme (not the list itself), and should be added at the bottom of the appropriate category.
The list I added

 has been around for at least 30 days,
 is the result of hard work and is the best I could possibly produce,
 is a non-generated Markdown file in a GitHub repo,
 is not a duplicate,
 includes a succinct description of the project/theme at the top (example),
 includes a project logo/illustration (whenever possible) at the top right of the readme (example). (The logo should link to the project website or any relevant website. The logo should be high-DPI, so set it to maximum half the width of the original image.),
 only has awesome items with descriptions (Awesome lists are curations of the best, not of everything),
 contains the awesome badge on the right side of the list heading,
 has a Table of Contents section named Contents as the first section,
 has an appropriate license (Meaning something like CC0, NOT a code licence like MIT, BSD, Apache, etc) (If you use a license badge, it should be SVG, not PNG),
