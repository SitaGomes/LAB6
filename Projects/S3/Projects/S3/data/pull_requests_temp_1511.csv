Description

The Open Weather Map API was not serving over HTTPS, leading to mixed content issues, since geolocation requires HTTPS. Forecast.io's API is also free, requires sign up, but up to 1k hits per day w/ no charge or card on file.
I'm (unsurprisingly) not the first person to notice this. Seems to intersect w/ #7853 and #9145, the latter I believe it closes, at least accounts for it from the documentation side of things (as the currently recommended open weather map API leads to a funny experience, at least for Chrome users).",1,1,1,{'totalCount': 17},{'totalCount': 7},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'freeCodeCamp', 'name': 'freeCodeCamp'}",1134.683611111111

Description

I've started contributing to FreeCodeCamp about a week ago. When I started contributing, I also joined the Contributors chat room. From my own experience and the experience of many other new contributors, I've found there's an issue in the npm run only-once command. \n on Windows doesn't add a new line. In fact, it's even worse. In the script, it seems to break. This pull request removes the new lines. I realize that this does make these little messages harder to catch. I think the trade-off is worth it, though. Because there is no new output for a while after the first message, and the last message is the very last thing logged, they're still hard to miss. I did some research on getting newlines in the command line on Windows, but there doesn't seem to be an easy cross-platform solution.
I hope this will help out new contributors, taking one more bump out of the road of contributing to a large open source project. 🔥",1,1,1,{'totalCount': 8},{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'freeCodeCamp', 'name': 'freeCodeCamp'}",69.93555555555555

Information Retrieval and Web Search is a field which involves finding relevant information for a given query, be it for as simple as a database search, or as complicated as a web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). There has been renewed interest in this field, thanks to Deep Learning and Vector Space Modeling. Finding content that is both relevant to the user, and has high topic relevance is the key point of research in this field. However, many don't know about the different resources available at out disposal. It would be a good idea to have a list of Awesome Information Retrieval and Web Search, for people to discover resources and make this field even more awesome.

./README-ja.md:RPCは振る舞いを公開することに焦点を当てています。RPCは内部通信パフォーマンスを理由として使われることが多いです。というのも、使用する状況に合わせてネーティブコールを自作することができるからです。

An OpenStack project that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run.
The name (Python Build Reasonableness) describes it well. It makes your setuptools config declarative, manages versioning via git tags, generates AUTHORS and CHANGELOG files from git log, picks up requirements.txt as dependencies, etc.
Very useful as a one-stop solution to packaging-related things; an alternative to combining multiple other projects (such as setuptools_scm + sh scripts interfacing with git + ...).

PyPattyrn is a python package aiming to make it easier and faster to implement design patterns into your own projects. Containing over 15 of the most common design patterns, you no longer have to write the same boilerplate code between all your projects when you wish to use a design pattern. This package captures that boilerplate code and makes it easy to use.
Example:
from pypattyrn.creational.singleton import Singleton

class DummyClass(object, metaclass=Singleton):
    ... 
DummyClass is now a Singleton.
What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?
Every other design pattern repo I've found simply provides examples for how to implement design patterns in python. PyPattyrn is something you would actually import into your project to speed up development process because the boilerplate code necessary for the design pattern is already written and provided for you by the package. I have not found another package that does the same thing.

What is this Python project?
Surprise is a Python scikit building and analysing recommender systems.
Main features:

Give the user perfect control over his experiments. To this end, a strong  emphasis is laid on   documentation, which we  have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every  details of the algorithms.
Alleviate the pain of Dataset  handling.   Users can use both built-in datasets
(Movielens,  Jester), and their own custom  datasets.
Provide various ready-to-use prediction  algorithms  such as baseline  algorithms,  neighborhood  methods, matrix  factorization-based (  SVD,  PMF,  SVD++,  NMF),  and many  others.  Also, various similarity
measures  (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
Make it easy to implement new algorithm  ideas.
Provide tools to evaluate,  analyse  and  compare  the algorithms performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very  easily, as well as exhaustive search over a set of  parameters.

What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?

According to any google search, crab is the go-to package for RS. But it actually only has one prediction algorithm (k-NN), no evaluation tools, no doc, and has been dead for three years.
The second most popular package I think is Recsys. Provides with two prediction algorithms (k-NN and SVD) but is also unmaintained. Evaluation tools are very minimal.
There's GraphLab, which is not free and needs license registration. I've heard good feedback about it, but never used it.
LightFM. This package is focused on a specific set of algorithms (all Boolean-valued) and does not provide with other classical approaches.

I think what makes Surprise is it's doc, the variety of prediction algorithms and the ability to evaluate the performances of algorithms easily (cross-validation, GridSearch, etc.). This makes it a useful tool to get your hands dirty quickly with recommender systems.

An advanced task flow management on top of famous Celery project (a distributed task queue). It allows one to create advanced task flows by creating YAML configuration files which state dependencies between tasks, fallback tasks (run on task failures) or run whole flows (transitively or even recursively). Dependencies between tasks or flows are graphs (without any limitation to DAG). It also enables one to use different storage or database adapters or running only certain tasks in a flow definition - system will automatically compute dependencies between tasks (which tasks needs to be run in order to run desired tasks). Selinon comes with a set of prepared storage/database adapters and support for tracing system actions (easy to integrate with Sentry or other monitoring systems) or logging ELK (Elasticsearch, logstash, Kibana) stack to provide ready-to-be-used system in clusters (using Kubernetes, OpenShift or others). A built in simutor can run your flows by executing CLI.

994,CLOSED,2017-12-29T11:30:19Z,,2019-11-06T11:36:38Z,Remove links to Python design patterns repository,"Replace with link to video showing why many patterns are unnecessary.
In my opinion, the linked repos (python-patterns and PyPatterns) are really unhelpful ways of thinking about patterns in Python - they are anti-patterns in Python, and not something that should be promoted.
Basically, most of the patterns popular in Java world are ""invisible or simpler"" in dynamic languages like Python (according to Peter Norvig - http://www.norvig.com/design-patterns/ ). This is due to:

the pattern being built in (e.g. iterator)
various language features, especially:

first class functions (command, strategy,
template-method, visitor)
first class types (factory, abstract factory, flyweight, factory method, state, proxy, chain-of-responsibility)



Of the two links, PyPatterns is the worst, and actually encourages importing a library to get functionality that only increases the amount of code you have to write. I see that it was added because someone wanted something they could actually import. However, this comes from people thinking in Java - but Python is not Java without the compile. There is negative value in using this kind of repo - Python makes the pattern invisible or simpler, by adding an import and base classes you have only made life hard for yourself.
For example, Factory and Abstract Factory pattern:
https://github.com/tylerlaberge/PyPattyrn#factory-pattern
https://github.com/faif/python-patterns/blob/master/creational/abstract_factory.py
Once you understand that Python has first class types, these become totally pointless.
Here is a class in Python:
class A:
    pass

And here is a factory for it:
A

(A is it's own factory - when you call it, it produces an object of type A. There is no new keyword in Python.)
And here is a factory that you can assign to a variable, or pass as an argument to a function/method:
A

(First class types.)
And here is a factory if you wanted to create A in a non-default way:
lambda:  A(some_parameter=123)

Or, in a builtin-standard-but-non-default way
class A:
    def __init__(self, enabled=True)
        self.enabled = enabled

    @classmethod
    def create_disabled(cls):
        return cls(enabled=False)

# Factory callable you can pass around:
A.create_disabled

These are the idiomatic ways to do these things. If you are writing anything more than that, you are doing it wrong.
Even when the pattern is bigger than invisible, its implementation is often massively simpler in Python. The linked repositories often use classes with no state and a single method. This is pointless - we should be deleting such classes and replacing them a single callable - see Stop Writing Classes
PyPatterns even includes an implementation of iterator and iterable - when these are built in to Python!
I was going to submit PRs to the linked repositories, but most of the PRs would involve deleting 90% of the code, which is unlikely to be accepted, I thought it better to submit this PR first.",1,2,2,{'totalCount': 3},{'totalCount': 3},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'vinta', 'name': 'awesome-python'}",16248.105277777779

Snips NLU has been designed to run very fast, with a very low memory footprint, while achieving very good prediction accuracy (cf this blogpost).
This library offers an interface with snips-nlu-rs, its Rust equivalent for inference only. It allows to persist the NLU pipeline trained with the python code, and load it with the rust code to perform inference. This offers a great portability.

6914,CLOSED,2016-05-28T22:37:05Z,,2017-03-01T21:34:04Z,"Add React.PureComponent, inherit purity for functional components","React.PureComponent
This provides an easy way to indicate that components should only rerender when given new props, like PureRenderMixin. If you rely on mutation in your React components, you can continue to use React.Component.
Inheriting from React.PureComponent indicates to React that your component doesn't need to rerender when the props are unchanged. We'll compare the old and new props before each render and short-circuit if they're unchanged. It's like an automatic shouldComponentUpdate, but it also affects the behavior of functional children that are rendered:
Functional components
We've heard clearly that most React users intend for their functional components to be pure and to produce different output only if the component's props have changed (https://mobile.twitter.com/reactjs/status/736412808372314114). However, a significant fraction of users still rely on mutation in their apps; when used with mutation, comparing props on each render could lead to components not updating even when the data is changed.
Therefore, we're changing functional components to behave as pure when they're used inside a React.PureComponent but to rerender unconditionally when contained in a React.Component:
class Post extends React.PureComponent {  // or React.Component
  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""post"">
        <PostHeader model={this.props.model} />
        <PostBody model={this.props.model} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

function PostHeader(props) {
  // ...
}

function PostBody(props) {
  // ...
}
In this example, the functional components PostHeader and PostBody will be treated as pure because they're rendered by a pure parent component (Post). If our app used mutable models instead, Post should extend React.Component, which would cause PostHeader and PostBody to rerender whenever Post does, even if the model object is the same.
We anticipate that this behavior will work well in real-world apps: if you use immutable data, your class-based components can extend React.PureComponent and your functional components will be pure too; if you use mutable data, your class-based components will extend React.Component and your functional components will update accordingly.
In the future, we might adjust these heuristics to improve performance. For example, we might do runtime detection of components like
function FancyButton(props) {
  return <Button style=""fancy"" text={props.text} />;
}
and optimize them to ""inline"" the child Button component and call it immediately, so that React doesn't need to store the props for Button nor allocate a backing instance for it -- causing less work to be performed and reducing GC pressure.",14,382,64,{'totalCount': 91},{'totalCount': 21},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'facebook', 'name': 'react'}",6646.949722222223

Firstly I moved all our non-top-level requires to the top level and __DEV__ on their usage (we only have 5 files that have that). Since we no longer have dynamic parts in our require/exports, they are pretty much ES6-compliant. Then there's a Babel pass for Rollup to firstly rewrite all require/exports to ES6 import/exports, and finally it bundles to a flat file (in UMD format). It sounds weird to transpile files from ES5 to ES6 but using this babel pass results in smaller file sizes comparing with using Rollup's CommonJS plugin.
This decreases our gzipped minified (prod) file size by ~10% and some of the benchmarks look pretty good.

This is a resubmission of pull request #6459. Just to recap...
The addition of the unsupported property warning (#6800) reminded my old PR (#6459) and I was curious about reopening it... So here we are.
This pull request configures DOMPropertyOperations to allow all attributes to pass through. It maintains the whitelist only for attributes that need special behavior, such as boolean props and name translations (like className).
While I was at it, I also eliminated the duplicated list of ""reserved props"" between ReactDOMUnknownPropertyDevtool and ReactDOMComponent through a new isReservedProp method on DOMProperty.

Introducing the React Release Manager, built to replace all of the manual steps involved in maintaining & shipping React.
Primary focus so far has been the most time-intensive & error prone steps. But automating more of this process is super important as we want to be able to turn around releases much more quickly, and ensure more people feel confident doing it (I've run almost every release since we started)
Quick overview:

docs-prs: replaces a GH label search, opening a bunch of tabs, copying the merge sha, cherry-pick each of those, push, batch remove label on GH
stable-prs: similar docs process but with milestones
version: replaces manually editing a bunch of files before release (or other similar steps, eventually became me using patch)
npm-publish: replaces a couple commands in my shell history, or a fancy ls build/packages/*.tgz | xargs -n1 npm publish

Plans:

publish: do the whole thing
version-start: create/update branches for release prep work (eg, just shipped 15.3.0, make sure dev branch exists)
changelog: generate a naive version of the changelog from X to Y (maybe just added to stable-prs command)
a whole bunch of refinement and error handling, state checking (eg, don't try to do anything if git state is dirty or on the wrong branch)",17,1199,0,{'totalCount': 0},{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'facebook', 'name': 'react'}",4046.5558333333333

More cases (and what fixes look like) here: #7253 (comment)
Issues with uncontrolled inputs
This is because assigning defaultValue causes side-effects on value. It seems to trigger validation on value as if it were directly assigned itself.
This Codepen provides a step by step reproduction case:
http://codepen.io/nhunzaker/pen/zBaokp

This PR wraps the defaultValue assignment in a conditional so that it will only ever be assigned if the defaultValue has changed.
Issues with controlled inputs
It looks like the issue here is that value is being assigned using the standard React method of updating attributes when the props get passed in here:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/shared/ReactDOMComponent.js#L926
There is some logic in ReactDOMInput to prevent duplicate values from being assigned here:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/wrappers/ReactDOMInput.js#L201-L210
Unfortunately the new value has already been assigned.
This PR adds a check for the value prop, and only assigns it if is different. It never assigns the value attribute if it hasn't changed:
I don't really know why this works. I didn't think node.setAttribute('value', value) was meaningful. What do you think?

This is a reimplementation of #7359 that additionally eliminates much of the work done inside of ReactDOMInput to handle quirks associated with defaultValue, value, defaultChecked, and checked.
It does this by ensuring a specific order for property assignment on the input element. This is implemented within DOMProperty and HTMLDOMPropertyConfig, which may allow for other elements to eventually take advantage of it (should they need it).
Performance changes
Since they do less work, controlled inputs are slightly faster, while non-ordered HTML tags have no observable performance regression (in my ability to test, anyway).
Fixes from the original PR
This is a major deviation from my solution in #7359, but it includes the same input fixes. These are enumerated in #7253 (comment). Basically, since the mutation method for value first checks to see if the property is loosely the same, it eliminates many edge cases with controlled number inputs, like:

Controlled and uncontrolled numbers won't drop off decimal places when backspacing, like converting 3. to 3
Controlled numbers that use parseFloat or parseInt won't ""expand"" values, like magically replace 3e1 with 30.

Other fixes
Some fixes are no longer necessary inside of ReactDOMInput:

Assigning type and step before value for IE11
Properly ordering defaultValue/value for inputs to ensure date inputs display properly on Android and iOS.
Ensure defaultChecked does not influence checked in Chrome 50.x

x = ReactTestRenderer.create(<a />);

div = ReactTestRenderer.create(<div><a /></div>);
x = div.getChildren()[0];
div.update(<div><b /></div>);
x.getType();

then since x points directly to the original <a /> child, there's no possible way we could return 'b'. So rather than have a confusing inconsistency between the top-level node and all the lower ones, @gaearon suggested outlawing changing type and key so that you always have the same instance.
I'm not actually sure I like this. It might make more sense to distinguish between the top-level instance and the children in the API -- since it also makes sense to call .update and .unmount at the top but nowhere else.

@philipshurpik, if you meant to keep on working on #6940, please let me know and I'll close this one.
The idea is to return a PropTypeError whenever one of ReactPropTypes is passed to ReactPropTypes.oneOf. The error message, hints that the user might be meaning to use ReactPropTypes.oneOfType instead.

If createChainableTypeChecker is called with an expectedType we add the expectedType flag to the checkType function (see [1])
In createEnumTypeChecker.validate, if expectedValues[i] is of type function and it has the expectedType flag, we know that a ReactPropTypes has been passed, so we throw the error described above
As per #6940, if a generic function is passed to ReactPropTypes.oneOf we improve the previous output to display ""Unexpected function"" and the function converted to string

As a side note, I noticed that if getPropType is called with undefined, we get the following exception:
Cannot read property '@@toStringTag' of undefined
Is this expected?

I want to stress that this is a short-term solution. It works and the reasoning is sound but I'm not happy that we need this. It's probably time to start using webpack to bundle but that would have taken me much longer to go do.
Byte-wise this should be fine. We're just adding the code that you can see in there. Since we do this after the bundle process is done, that require('react') isn't analyzed.
Todo:

 Look for any other expected globals in shims
 Use this in other bundles
 Look into the RequireJS situation. I honestly don't care much about that but we should probably make it work. It would require rejiggering the wrapper (since we couldn't execute the UMDed module immediately)

Made a hello world app with webpack and aliased react and react-dom.

3710,CLOSED,2016-09-20T20:00:18Z,,2016-10-12T04:56:07Z,Allow for function as child,"Function as a child is a very powerful pattern employed in react.  It allows the consumer of a component to choose how to render a component, while having access to data passed down by the parent.
It is similar to slots, in a way, except slots only gain you access to the data in the hosting component.
For more information on the possibilities that this pattern enables, please see this blog post, this presentation from Ryan Florence at React Rally, as well as the new API for React Router 4.0.
Before I go on, I do want to say that the pattern is achievable right now using props:
It is possible now to mimic this using props with the following pattern:
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    props: ['render'],
    render (h) {
       return this.render('Hello, World');
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData render={data => <span>{data}</span>}></ComponentWithData>
    }
})

However, ""first-class"" support would be nice.
As far as the vue flavor, the API looks like this:
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    render (h) {
       return this.$slots.default('Hello, World')
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData>{data => <span>{data}</span>}</ComponentWithData>
    }
})

A couple of things:

In my implementation, if an array is passed for children, and any of the children are a function, that will throw away all children, except for the function

The basic idea here is, skip checking async component when hydration. To support this, I introduced a new flag on VNode isAsyncPlaceholder. A placeholder VNode is same as an emptyVNode, except the new flag set to true. Before this commit, an async component will be rendered to emptyVNode(in createElement). After this commit, an async component will be rendered to placeholderVNode. So the behavior in client-side rendering or bailed SSR rendering should be kept.
In SSR hydration, we skip checking a placeholder VNode against a real element. After component is resolved, the Vue instance in question will $forceUpdate in callback. So even if the real element dismatches with resolved VNode, rendered dom structure should be up to date.
Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because isHydrating is not available in createComponent.
Another potential problem is that third party code can attach event handler / store data on SSR element. Those information will be lost in $forceUpdate callback.

I am working on integration of Vue with Meteor and I would like that Vue could be a drop-in replacement for Blaze. That is almost possible, because architecture is very similar. Vue is also using reactive dependency tracking, observer, while Meteor/Blaze is using Tracker. Now, there is a lot of code written for Meteor which is using Tracker and it would be great if it could just work with Vue. And in fact it is doable. I managed to create a full 100% compatible Tracker implementation on top of Vue's observer. But there are some changes necessary to observer's implementation and some internals have to be exposed.
This pull request is initial version of changes I had to do to get this first version of Tracker implemented, to get discussion rolling. I would really like to see if this or something like this could get merged into Vue. From my perspective changes do not really change how observer is working, and all existing tests are still passing.
A list of changes:

added support for after flush callbacks
adding a way to force flushing
fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget
correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter
exposing some internals (probably too much, API could be cleaner there)

Requesting comments, feedback, suggestions. This is work in progress. I will add tests in the future, after we finalize that this is OK to do and everything else.

This is a PR to add TypeScript definition files for Vue.js 1.x into this repository.
Since Vue decided to bundle its definition files, they were hosted on DefinitelyTyped.

DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13230
DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13235
DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#13236

However, as these PRs imply, vue.d.ts was removed and currently there's no way to manage the 1.x's one.
In addition, there were a lot of changes between 2.x's and 1.x's definition, such as vuejs namespace, plural or singular. So I changed its content in order to allow users to use what version they like with TypeScript.
Of course, the past definitions were written for TS 1.x, but this one is for TS 2.x.

[  581.465203] i2c_hid i2c-ELAN1200:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (16/65535)
Also there were the next bugs:

If you touch touchpad with 5 fingers, the driver dies immediately.
When you scroll anything, and release one finger, driver thought you are still scrolling

Recently, I spoke to ELANTECH and they send me a patch suggested by Intel to fix this issue. It was a simple hack, so me and guys from redhat forum created this patch.
It is fixed by adding additional quirk to trigger IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING flag.
An explanation about why i2c_hid_init_irq section was moved under the i2c_hid_lookup_quirk, answered by Hans de Goede hdegoede@redhat.com:

i2c_hid_init_irq now checks for a quirk, so we must setup the quirks before we init the irq, and we cannot setup the quirk earlier, so we must init the irq later.

So this commit revert's this commit, as no message flood can be seen by now, and fixes touchpad problems.

Changelog
Sourced from pip's changelog.

23.3 (2023-10-15)
Process

Added reference to vulnerability reporting guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/security/>_ to pip's security policy.

Deprecations and Removals

Drop a fallback to using SecureTransport on macOS. It was useful when pip detected OpenSSL older than 1.0.1, but the current pip does not support any Python version supporting such old OpenSSL versions. ([#12175](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12175) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12175>_)

Features

Improve extras resolution for multiple constraints on same base package. ([#11924](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924>_)
Improve use of datastructures to make candidate selection 1.6x faster. ([#12204](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12204) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12204>_)
Allow pip install --dry-run to use platform and ABI overriding options. ([#12215](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12215) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12215>_)
Add is_yanked boolean entry to the installation report (--report) to indicate whether the requirement was yanked from the index, but was still selected by pip conform to :pep:592. ([#12224](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12224) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12224>_)

Bug Fixes

Ignore errors in temporary directory cleanup (show a warning instead). ([#11394](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394) <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394>_)
Normalize extras according to :pep:685 from package metadata in the resolver
for comparison. This ensures extras are correctly compared and merged as long
as the package providing the extra(s) is built with values normalized according

The function blk_mq_virtio_map_queues currently assumes that the number of available interrupt vectors in the virtio device is equal to or greater than the number of queues. However, this assumption may not always hold true, especially in scenarios where the number of vectors is less than the number of queues.
This patch enhances blk_mq_virtio_map_queues to support dynamic allocation of interrupt vectors. If the number of available vectors is less than the number of queues, the function now dynamically allocates vectors and assigns queues accordingly.
This enhancement ensures better compatibility and scalability for systems with virtio devices where the number of vectors may be limited.

Release notes
Sourced from urllib3's releases.

2.2.2
🚀 urllib3 is fundraising for HTTP/2 support
urllib3 is raising ~$40,000 USD to release HTTP/2 support and ensure long-term sustainable maintenance of the project after a sharp decline in financial support for 2023. If your company or organization uses Python and would benefit from HTTP/2 support in Requests, pip, cloud SDKs, and thousands of other projects please consider contributing financially to ensure HTTP/2 support is developed sustainably and maintained for the long-haul.
Thank you for your support.
Changes

Added the Proxy-Authorization header to the list of headers to strip from requests when redirecting to a different host. As before, different headers can be set via Retry.remove_headers_on_redirect.
Allowed passing negative integers as amt to read methods of http.client.HTTPResponse as an alternative to None. (#3122)
Fixed return types representing copying actions to use typing.Self. (#3363)

If your company or organization uses Python and would benefit from HTTP/2 support in Requests, pip, cloud SDKs, and thousands of other projects please consider contributing financially to ensure HTTP/2 support is developed sustainably and maintained for the long-haul.
Thank you for your support.
Changes

Fixed issue where InsecureRequestWarning was emitted for HTTPS connections when using Emscripten. (#3331)
Fixed HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen to stop automatically casting non-proxy headers to HTTPHeaderDict. This change was premature as it did not apply to proxy headers and HTTPHeaderDict does not handle byte header values correctly yet. (#3343)
Changed ProtocolError to InvalidChunkLength when response terminates before the chunk length is sent. (#2860)
Changed ProtocolError to be more verbose on incomplete reads with excess content. (#3261)

2.2.0
🖥️ urllib3 now works in the browser
🎉 This release adds experimental support for using urllib3 in the browser with Pyodide! 🎉
Thanks to Joe Marshall (@​joemarshall) for contributing this feature. This change was possible thanks to work done in urllib3 v2.0 to detach our API from http.client. Please report all bugs to the urllib3 issue tracker.

Fixed issue where requests against urls with trailing dots were failing due to SSL errors
when using proxy. (#2244)

i.e.
Without
a, cc, bbb --> a, bbb, cc
With
a, cc, bbb --> a, cc, bbb
Even with the custom compare, you are not always guaranteed a stable sort
Example: Given: [aa, q, a, bbbb, ccc]
The algorithm will start with a SWAP from the right most index and the middle of the array.

START SWAP ""ccc"", ""a""
END SWAP (New Array: aa,q,ccc,bbbb,a)
""aa"" is greater than ""a""
START SWAP ""aa"", ""a""
END SWAP a,q,ccc,bbbb,aa
""ccc"" is greater than ""aa""
START INSRIGHT  (Given: a,q,bbbb,bbbb,aa)
END INSRIGHT (New Array: a,q,bbbb,aa,ccc)
""bbbb""is greater than ""aa""
START INSRIGHT (Given: a,q,bbbb,aa,ccc)
END INSRIGHT  (New Array: a,q,aa,ccc,bbbb)

Finished:

After I figured out what was causing the issue, I couldn't really get a discussion of possible solutions going. I figured I would just go ahead and create a PR with the simplest and most immediate fix to get the ball rolling.
The fix is simple, gcc needs to be passed -fno-canonical-system-headers, and this PR makes it recognize this flag if it's passed to crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc and pass it along to the compiler command.
However, one could argue that there are more general and better solutions, such as passing through all -f... flags (there are actually currently many flags that are passed into the Python script that are not passed along). If anyone feels strongly about such an alternative solution, I would like to discuss the details of it before putting together a replacement PR.

EDIT: Some explanation, for people unfamiliar with the situation: The Trello board is very outdated, so it causes much confusion to students. For example, this conversation on discord: https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/744682430853808178/1208263221086126161. We usually recommend people in the discord server to just fork this repo and add ✅ next to courses they have completed. This PR removes the information about Trello board and adds the suggestion from the discord server to this repo too. (This PR closes #1089)
There are many third-party/outdated/unmaintained materials related to OSSU on the internet (like the Trello board and some notion templates from youtubers). This PR also adds a warning to students to be aware that those materials are outdated.
The spreadsheet used to track time required to complete the curriculum can also become outdated some time. The current status is that some links to courses are outdated (like HTDP -> SPD change is not there) and experimental suggestions such as CS50P are not mentioned, but the spreadsheet still correctly estimates the time required, which is its main function.

More than 2 years ago, Oh My Zsh merged the Pull Request #1355, which introduced a fix to be able to use terminfo sequences to specify key codes to bindkey, with the intention to make it standard for everyone and not having to change bindkey sequences all the time.
That experiment failed, and it's been obviously clear for quite a while. Since then lots of issues have popped up where certain combinations of keys didn't work (see list of Fixes below), and the culprit of that is that terminfo databases are not maintained all that well and there is not consistent support among Terminal Emulators.
This is why we're choosing to drop that experiment, and use a custom wrapper around bindkey named omz_bindkey were you'll be able to choose whichever modifier keys you want ─ CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, META ─ instead of having to use an obscure character sequence like '^[[OH'.
Here's where you come into play: since this is a big change, we need a broad number of users to test in their respective configurations, with as many Terminal Emulators as we can, before we can safely merge this PR knowing that there won't be many users affected.
Thanks for taking the time to read this; in this GitHub guide you'll find how you can check out this PR locally. After that, restart your terminal or run exec zsh to reload Oh My Zsh.
Please report back if there are any keyboard shortcuts broken in your system with the following information:

Your current bindkey configuration: run bindkey and post its output.
Anything else that you think is relevant.

That is all. Thanks again for participating in this! ─ @mcornella

Description
I think it's time to abandon smkx/rmkx and stick with ""local"" keypad mode, even if it requires us to hardcode a few character sequences instead of using terminfo for everything. This PR does so, adding an omz_bindkey function that allows us to still use terminfo capability codes in key bindings, and supports cursor keys with modifiers. This should fix a whole slew of these recurring cursor-key terminal issues.

Discussion
Switching to use smkx/rmkx application mode and terminfo for portability was a good idea: you're supposed to use portability libraries for stuff like this. But I think it's time to call it a failed experiment. Not because the implementation in OMZ was bad, but because terminfo and the various terminal programs out there don't have sufficient support for it.
I dug pretty deep in to this issue, and I think that the smkx/rmkx+terminfo solution cannot be made to work for everyone. And you'll continue to see issues reported for it. But local mode with a few hardcoded sequences can work.
The smkx/rmkx approach is defeated by a few factors:

Terminal emulators vary in their application mode behavior, and don't necessarily match xterm, which is what most people use for their $TERM, even if they're really running a different program
terminfo conflates the mode setting for cursor keypads and the numeric keypads: [sr]mkx changes both, but we only want the cursor keypads changed
the program-specific terminfo database entries for PuTTY, Terminal.app, and other programs may not be installed on a given system, or may be incomplete or out of date. We don't want to require custom installation of terminfo entries if we can possibly avoid it.

Using smkx/rmkx is also complicated because:

Most terminal-related code snippets on forums, StackOverflow, and the rest of the internet are for local mode, so they won't work in OMZ if we use [sr]mkx
bash only supports local mode, so bash cursor code can't be used under [sr]mkx
Most people don't know about [sr]mkx, so educating people about it becomes part of every bug report for keypad problems
Using [sr]mkx requires using the zle-line-init and zle-line-finish hooks, which conflicts with anything else that wants to use them (including some OMZ plugins).

zle-line-init/finish hooks
As part of this PR's changes, Oh My Zsh completely takes over the zle-line-init and zle-line-finish hooks, replacing them with functions that provide support for multiple hook functions to be registered. This is done for two independent reasons. Primarily, it's to clobber and remove any zle-line-init/finish hooks installed by zsh configuration files supplied by the system. Some Linux distributions define hooks which do the [sr]mkx thing, and we need to make sure that doesn't happen. Secondly, it allows for multiple OMZ plugins to install line-init/finish hooks without conflicting with each other.
As part of this, we're essentially having OMZ declare zle-line-init/finish to be completely its territory. I think this is okay.
Implementation
The terminfo-based key binding code was a lot easier to read, because it used mnemonic terminfo capability codes instead of literal terminal control sequences. So this PR adds an omz_bindkey extension on top of bindkey that allows you to still use those codes. (It also adds logging support, which would make diagnosing key binding issues a lot easier, because you could see which plugins or user code is doing which binding.) I think this makes the key binding code a lot more readable, both as it is, and in the diffs for future PRs.
The omz_bindkey layer keeps a supplemental little database of character sequences based on xterm's local mode behavior (which is not in terminfo), and uses those for cursor keys. It also includes a couple hacks for specific known misbehaving or variant terminal programs. And it has support for binding modifier-key (alt/ctrl/shift) cursor keys, which terminfo doesn't itself provide.
Future considerations
If you like this approach and merge it, I'll follow it up with a PR for multiple keymap support in the key bindings, which will take care of the issues caused by flipping between the emacs and vi keymaps during the OMZ startup sequence.",7,251,105,{'totalCount': 31},{'totalCount': 12},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'ohmyzsh', 'name': 'ohmyzsh'}",69988.12333333334

 #2589: Respect original PATH definitions on install
 #4317: Should export PATH contain $PATH in .zshrc?
 #4925: Remove undesirable hardcoding of PATH into zshrc

Fixes #1359. Fixes #2586. Fixes #4925. Closes #2589. Closes #4317.
New features
Skip change of default shell

 #4261: Prevent shell change during setup
 #7100: Suggestion: add a flag to bypass setting zsh as default shell
 #7266: Adds skip-chsh flag to switch login shell step
 #7721: Installation script shouldn't alter default shell
 #7865: Make setting the default shell during installation optional

Fixes #4261. Fixes #7100. Fixes #7266. Fixes #7721. Fixes #7865.
The installer respects the environment variable CHSH. Set to no, it will skip the chsh step. It also reads the flag --skip-chsh which has the same effect. For instance, these two are equivalent:
CHSH=no sh install.sh
sh install.sh --skip-chsh
Don't run zsh after install

 #4393: [Discuss] What should installer behavior be, esp wrt launching new shells?
 #5002: add a way to not launch zsh after finishing
 #5853: Add a flag to prevent the ""launch"" of zsh
 #5893: Allow batch mode installation
 #6547: Add support for --silent option in install.sh script
 #7790: Add non-interactive option to install script

Fixes #4393. Fixes #5002. Fixes #5853. Fixes #5893. Fixes #6547. Fixes #7790.
As in the skip-chsh feature above, the installer respects the variable RUNZSH, which when set to no will skip the zsh call when the install is done. The flag --unattended also sets RUNZSH=no, as well as setting CHSH=no. So these two are equivalent:
RUNZSH=no CHSH=no sh install.sh
sh install.sh --unattended
Forks

 #3648: Installer: add ability to install from forked repos
 #5628: Zsh installer defaults to main repo even if installed from fork sync
 #7496: make installation script configurable for forks

Fixes #3648. Fixes #5628. Fixes #7496.
The installer respects the following environment variables, that can be set up when calling it with VAR=value sh install.sh.

REPO: value in the form of owner/project. Useful for forks in GitHub (defaults to `robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
BRANCH: default branch to check out once the clone has finished (defaults to master).
REMOTE: full remote URL (supersedes REPO if set). You could for example choose an ssh remote URL, like git@github.com:user/oh-my-zsh, or another fork from GitLab or Bitbucket.

This PR fixes #31
This PR adds functionality to the project to allow for a choice between the original Google search method and the Google Custom Search API. The google_search method uses the original method of scraping the HTML from the search results page, using googlesearch-python, while the google_official_search method uses the Google Custom Search API to retrieve search results. Note the Google Custom Search API provides 100 search queries per day for free. If you need more, you may sign up for billing in the API Console. Additional requests cost $5 per 1000 queries, up to 10k queries per day.
How to test:
To test the functionality, ensure that you have valid API keys and search engine IDs for both the Google search method and the Google Custom Search API. You can set these values in your environment variables as described in the README.md file.
Additional Notes:
This pull request only adds functionality and makes improvements to existing code. No new features or major changes have been introduced.",5,101,12,{'totalCount': 8},{'totalCount': 8},{'totalCount': 4},"{'owner': 'Significant-Gravitas', 'name': 'AutoGPT'}",1.8541666666666667

It includes information about his early life, acting career, other ventures such as activism and philanthropy, personal life, and filmography and accolades. It details his rise to fame with Titanic and his work as an actor and producer since then. It also highlights his activism, philanthropy, and charitable donations. Additionally, there are pages dedicated to his movies, reviews, awards, personal life, and more.

Whereas with my changes, the agents will cleanly find the answer to the question:

The problem:
_setScrollbar() and _resetScrollbar() in file js/src/modal.js failed to properly adjust padding-right when opening and closing modals, while using fixed elements (ie fixed-top navbar). Both functions had to be rewritten.
Changes:
_setScrollbar() -- called when opening a modal

Store the original body padding-right in data-padding-right
Adjust the body padding-right according to the calculated _scrollbarWidth
Store the fixed element's original padding-right in data-padding-right
Adjust the element's padding-right according to the calculated _scrollbarWidth
Store the navbar-toggler's original margin-right in data-margin-right
Adjust the navbar-toggler's margin-right according to the calculated _scrollbarWidth

_resetScrollbar() -- called when closing a modal

Restore original body padding-right and remove the data attribute
Restore original fixed element's padding-right and remove the data attribute
Restore original navbar-toggler's margin-right and remove the data attribute

Unit Tests

Fixed missing modal-scrollbar-measure in modal unit tests
Fixed test for body padding adjustment
Added tests for fixed element padding adjustment
Added tests for navbar-toggler margin adjustment
Removed some unused tests from previous, incomplete patches

We've already broken each group of utilities out into new pages with #20068, and now I'm cleaning things up to make utilities more granular, easier to use, and more flexible to a multitude of use cases.

Changed syntax of spacing utilities to help avoid collision with Microformats (see #20185). This doesn't completely resolve the problem, however, because I want to move from .pa-*/.ma-* to just .p-* and .m-* to avoid a weird and unclear abbreviation of ""all"" there.
Revamps the text and background color utilities. Background utilities no longer set a color; you now apply that with a separate utility for more control. Also new is a .text-white for those common cases where you just want white text on dark background.
Renames .img-rounded an .img-circle to .rounded and .rounded-circle. Also, add new utilities for rounding a complete side of an element (e.g., .rounded-top or .rounded-right). (Pulls in commits from #20363 to fix #20266.)
Removes display: block; from .img-fluid. Responsive image behavior is not dependent on display: block;, so we can safely remove it on our end. Should you need block level, you can easily override that in the source or with a utility class.

Still to do:

 Rename the .pull-* classes to reflect their CSS property, .float-*.
 Update all instances of background utilities to ensure color contrast. Punting.
 Consider reorganizing these new utility docs a bit more (e.g., combine display and responsive display, combine floats and clearfix, or something to that effect). Punting.
 Update all URLs that link to and within the new utility docs.
 Audit and make consistent use of !important.
 Add vertical alignment utilities Punting to 4.1 ideas in #20866

The idea here is what we have discussed: make ITextModelResolverService the one-stop-shop for retrieving (workbench) text editor models, given a URI. The resolve method was renamed to a getModelReference() which returns a reference to a model. The contract is to dispose() that reference once the caller doesn't need the model any more.
This PR adopts that interface and implements it for the contributable content provider models. The other two types (file: and untitled:) are wrapped around ImmortalReferences, which means they will live on forever, just like they have so far, until someone calls dispose() on the model itself. This needs adoption in the future. The PR further fulfils the reference contract by calling dispose() when the models are no longer needed. @jrieken this is mostly your area.
The big goal is to allow proper disposal of text editor models without resorting to ugly methods such as looping through all the open editors. This first step already lets me implement my dirty diff contribution while doing proper model cleanup.",24,413,277,{'totalCount': 4},{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 2},"{'owner': 'microsoft', 'name': 'vscode'}",23.398333333333333

Although they result in a  same usability/keybinding problem I initially described in #15103, my description was a little fuzzy because I didn't understand the cause fully.
There are currently 2 problems:

Problem Nr. 1
Whenever a second (or third, …) terminal instance gets exited via the shell command exit or by pressing ctrl-d (which basically is ""exit"" because it sends EOF), the terminal panel loses focus and the editor gets focus.
This hinders the workflow when working with multiple terminals, because you can't close a second one without refocusing the panel again, worst case scenario would be that a user write exit into an editor window without being aware of it.
The only case where focus has to change is if there is only 1 instance left, in this case the panel closes itself so the user has a visual clue about whats going on.
Just in case anyone asks, the reasoning I used focus(true) in setActiveInstanceByIndex() instead of inside _removeInstance() just in case there are some edge cases I didn't stumble upon yet. I'd guess you always want to focus your active instances, but correct me if I'm wrong.

Problem Nr. 2
To make the terminal work with various keyboard shortcuts, the setting terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell was introduced. The first part of my Issue I described in #15103 and I later found out to be described in #14969 as well is caused by the following:
Currently, the settings are only handled in the panel itself when _updateCommandsToSkipShell() is called (whenever the panel gets opened). If you create a new instance with either the +-Button in the GUI or via a shortcut, a new terminal instance get's created, gets attached – but _skipTerminalKeybindings is empty.
Calling the function to skip the commands from inside TerminalService#createInstance() made most sense to me because it's already aware of the settings, but correct me again if I'm wrong with this assumption.",4,36,29,{'totalCount': 7},{'totalCount': 4},{'totalCount': 5},"{'owner': 'microsoft', 'name': 'vscode'}",174.39194444444445

com.visualstudio.code.oss-x86_64.flatpak

Installing and running the application is achieved with:
$ flatpak --user install --bundle com.visualstudio.code.oss-x86_64.flatpak
$ flatpak run com.visualstudio.code.oss

(Removing --user would install the application system-wide.)
The org.freedesktop.Platform runtime needs to be installed for running the application, and for making builds the org.freedesktop.Sdk runtime is needed as well. There are installation instructions in the Flatpak website; the short version is:
wget https://sdk.gnome.org/keys/gnome-sdk.gpg
flatpak --user remote-add --gpg-import=gnome-sdk.gpg gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/repo/
flatpak --user install org.freedesktop.Platform 1.4
flatpak --user install org.freedesktop.Sdk 1.4

The flatpak-bundler development dependency provides an asynchronous API to invoke flatpak-builder. The gulp-image-resize module is used to
incorporate scaling of the application icon to multiple sizes, and uses ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) under the hood, which is commonly available on most GNU/Linux distributions.
Instead of building the Electron dependencies, this reuses the    io.atom.electron.BaseApp (source) bundle as base application. The contents of the base application are imported at build time, and then Electron and the prepared files added on top. The prebuilt base application will be fetched automatically using the URL specified in the baseFlatpakref attribute, and it is kindly hosted at Amazon S3 by Endless Computers.

updates flutter_tools and flutter_test to use the SDK-vended analyzer package
tweaks dependency tracking logic to only record the SDK-vended analyzer so as not to crash on spurious conflicts (due to transitive dependencies)

Note that this means we will:

no longer need to manually publish analyzer packages in lock-step with SDK releases
no longer need to update flutter_tools and flutter_test on fresh SDK rolls
never have to worry about possible analysis skew between the analyzer (and server) vended in the SDK and the one pulled in via a package dependency in flutter_tools

Rolling to a new Dart SDK should become as simple as an update to bin/cache/dart-sdk-version.

suppress the pub override warning in bin/flutter and in flutter_tools/lib/src/dart/pub.dart
leave the analyzer override in the pubspec for flutter_tools; this is the only package we have that uses the analyzer API directly
let the analyzer version float in devicelab/pubspec.yaml and flutter_test/pubspec.yaml; we get the version that package:test specifies that it needs in its pubspec
(also pass in --no-packages-dir in bin/flutter, to mirror what we do when driving pub from dart code)

I think allowing the analyzer version to be different - that used by flutter_tools, and that used by packages that user code will depend on - is ok. flutter_tools is generally just a snapshot that users interact with, not something they're actively importing into their codebase. And this lets us use the exact same version of the analyzer as the SDK tools, which is nice - we won't have any version skew between analysis server based products and flutter analyze.

These template really aren't all that helpful because they are brittle in that the list of files is specific to a particular version of the software. Having a template for each version seems overkill, and in most cases you would be better off using ls or similar to automatically produce such a gitignore, if that's what you need.
See also #985 for my previous explanation of this problem. If we agree that this is a problem, then I propose to delete the templates which currently follow this pattern. If there is a way to curate a small, useful set of rules about these projects, then people can re-introduce them in new PRs, but the current list of rules seem unsalvageably messy in most cases.

Reasons for making this change:

Sage (or SageMath) is a popular mathematics software built atop Python.
Sage uses .sage files that it translates into .sage.py files to run.  Essentially these .sage.py are rather irrelevant as one wouldn't want to save them in most cases.
I suggest this edit to the Python .gitignore, seeing as it would be an overkill to add a whole new template for just for Sage (seeing as Sage is essentially an extension Python).

It's an implementation of the prompt2prompt feature mentioned here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xas2os/simple_prompt2prompt_implementation_with_prompt/
This allows you to insert or remove concepts at specific steps count to achieve better fine tuning:

Prompts work the same way as before but you can swap out text during rendering.Replacing concepts is done by:
[old concept:new concept:step]
where step is a step # or a percentage of all steps when < 1(so at 50 steps, .5 and 25 are the same), inserting new concepts:
[new concept:step]
removing concepts:
[old concept::step]

Without this feature, you would always add or remove concepts from step 1.
Some examples:
Prompt: fantasy landscape [with rocks:.25]
Description of what it should do: Add the concept ""with rocks"" at 25% of the generation

Prompt: fantasy landscape [with rocks:.75]
Description of what it should do: Add the concept ""with rocks"" at 75% of the generation

Updating from the comment in the conversation:

The 1x models work, but currently the app skips running the models if scale = 1
There are models with scales larger than 4 (8x and there are even 16x not in the DB), but the app has a max of scale 4
The BSRGAN model and arch files are not needed and I'm removing them in the PR. Just need to load the models as regular ESRGAN models.
The real-ESRGAN models now work with the same architecture, but a bit of a dependency exists currently in the application with the models that can be downloaded automatically with the get_realesrgan_models() function: 
  
    
      stable-diffusion-webui/modules/realesrgan_model.py
    
    
         Line 82
      in

           def get_realesrgan_models(scaler): 
        
    
  

, so I'm not removing the real-ESRGAN bits, but they can be loaded as regular ESRGAN models now. For this it would be possible to consider a separate list of suggested models to use that can be sent to the ""model downloader"" function (maybe one that does not depend on basicsr) to fetch them automatically. This list could include not only these real-ESRGAN models, but maybe also BSRGAN and any other, that way the entire real-ESRGAN file and import can be removed.
The parameter inference function (infer_params()) has the limitation that it depends on the models being translated beforehand to infer their parameters, which is why for two particular cases of real-ESRGAN (realesr-animevideov3.pth and RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth) there is one parameter for each that is set according to the filename. The others are automatic.

The first 2 points are not a major issue, but will need some thinking about how to go about it, also because the same slider is user for every upscaler option.

Makes it easier to use xy_grid generation parameters to generate individual images that can be more easily post-processed, such as being used to generate a comparative gif/animation/video
Makes it easier to compare two individual images from inside the webUI, by clicking on the two images consecutively and seeing them update in-lace
Makes it easier to see the images in more detail from the webUI, without needing to deal with manually zooming and scrolling parts of the large image, and reduces browser chug when trying to manipulate the huge monolith image

(Sorry for the churn -- I am not used to branch management and pull requests in GitHub)
This diff provides the option to add model's confidence as attention/emphasis

Why this change:

This is particularly useful when using Interrogate DeepBooru with low ""Score thresholds""

EG: If using Interrogate DeepBooru with a threshold of 0.5 (or even lower), you can get tags for minor scene components, which you can feed back into txt2img with the appropriate rates, to get scenes that more closely match the feel of the reference image.


It's mostly useful for keeping minor scene components in the prompt, without completely discarding them, and without having them contribute too much emphasis / influence over the final output
This can also give much better results when feeding the interrogate results back into either img2img or txt2img, especially when trying to generate a specific character or scene for which you have a similar concept image

Testing Steps:

Launch Webui with command line arg: --deepdanbooru
Navigate to img2img tab, use interrogate DeepBooru, verify tags appears as before. Use ""Interrogate CLIP"", verify prompt appears as before
Navigate to Settings tab, enable new option, click ""apply settings""
Navigate to img2img, Interrogate DeepBooru again, verify that weights appear and are properly formatted. Note that ""Interrogate CLIP"" prompt is still unchanged

In my testing, this change has no effect to ""Interrogate CLIP"", as it seems to generate a sentence-structured caption, and not a set of tags.",4,24,14,{'totalCount': 5},{'totalCount': 2},{'totalCount': 1},"{'owner': 'AUTOMATIC1111', 'name': 'stable-diffusion-webui'}",27.816388888888888

1. Randomness for img2imgalt not work
Randomness use p.seed as its seed.
But in processing.process_images, p.seed is not set:
    seed = get_fixed_seed(p.seed)
    subseed = get_fixed_seed(p.subseed)
As a result, rand_noise in sample_extra is always generated by the seed 0.
My solution is to use the parameter seeds as seeds, since this modifies the code changes very little(only 1 line).
2. Batch for img2imgalt's is not allowed
I know, without randomness, the batch for img2imgalt is meaningless.
However, since randomness is supported now, batch should be allowed.

According to wiki and my testing, these params should be fixed by default:

Sampling method: must be Euler
prompt/negative prompt: should be the same as original prompt/negative prompt.
Samping Steps: should be the same as decode steps
Denoising Strength: should be 1.0

Manual adjustments for these params should be saved.
Improvements

Automatically override Sampling method
Add checkboxes for overriding prompt, steps and  strength.
