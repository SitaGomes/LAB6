# GitHub Pull Request (PR) Analysis Report

Generated on: 2025-04-25 09:01:50

## Introduction

This report analyzes pull request activities on popular GitHub repositories to identify factors influencing PR merges from the contributor's perspective. We explore relationships between PR attributes and both final review feedback (merged or closed) and the number of reviews received.

### Initial Hypotheses

1. **PR Size**: Smaller PRs are more likely to be merged and receive fewer reviews.
2. **Analysis Duration**: PRs with shorter analysis times are more likely to be merged.
3. **Description Length**: PRs with detailed descriptions are more likely to be merged.
4. **Interactions**: PRs with more interactions (participants and comments) might be more controversial but ultimately more likely to be merged due to thorough review.

## Methodology

We collected data from top GitHub repositories with high activity levels. Each PR in our dataset has at least one review and was analyzed for more than one hour. We used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to measure relationships between variables, as it does not assume linear relationships and is robust against outliers.

## Results

### PR Attributes vs. Final Review Feedback

#### RQ01: PR Size and Final Review Feedback

Changed Files: Correlation = 0.020 (p-value = 0.714)
Total Changes: Correlation = 0.028 (p-value = 0.611)

Interpretation: There is no statistically significant correlation between PR size (files) and merge probability (p > 0.05).

#### RQ02: PR Analysis Duration and Final Review Feedback

Correlation = -0.274 (p-value = 0.000)

Interpretation: There is a weak negative correlation between analysis duration and merge probability (correlation = -0.274, p < 0.05).

#### RQ03: PR Description Length and Final Review Feedback

Correlation = -0.025 (p-value = 0.653)

Interpretation: There is no statistically significant correlation between description length and merge probability (p > 0.05).

#### RQ04: PR Interactions and Final Review Feedback

Participants: Correlation = -0.174 (p-value = 0.001)
Comments: Correlation = -0.059 (p-value = 0.279)

Interpretation: There is a weak negative correlation between number of participants and merge probability (correlation = -0.174, p < 0.05).

### PR Attributes vs. Number of Reviews

#### RQ05: PR Size and Number of Reviews

Changed Files: Correlation = 0.077 (p-value = 0.160)
Total Changes: Correlation = 0.129 (p-value = 0.018)

Interpretation: There is no statistically significant correlation between PR size (files) and number of reviews (p > 0.05).

#### RQ06: PR Analysis Duration and Number of Reviews

Correlation = 0.144 (p-value = 0.008)

Interpretation: There is a weak positive correlation between analysis duration and number of reviews (correlation = 0.144, p < 0.05).

#### RQ07: PR Description Length and Number of Reviews

Correlation = 0.144 (p-value = 0.008)

Interpretation: There is a weak positive correlation between description length and number of reviews (correlation = 0.144, p < 0.05).

#### RQ08: PR Interactions and Number of Reviews

Participants: Correlation = 0.306 (p-value = 0.000)
Comments: Correlation = 0.349 (p-value = 0.000)

Interpretation: There is a moderate positive correlation between number of participants and number of reviews (correlation = 0.306, p < 0.05).

## Discussion and Conclusion

Based on our findings, we can draw several conclusions about factors that influence PR reviews:

1. **PR Size**: Our data neither supports nor refutes the hypothesis that "Smaller PRs are more likely to be merged" due to lack of statistical significance.

2. **Analysis Duration**: Our data supports the hypothesis that "PRs with shorter analysis times are more likely to be merged". Longer analysis duration negatively correlates with merge probability.

3. **Description Length**: Our data neither supports nor refutes the hypothesis that "PRs with detailed descriptions are more likely to be merged" due to lack of statistical significance.

4. **Interactions**: Our data contradicts the hypothesis that "PRs with more interactions are more likely to be merged due to thorough review". The number of participants correlates with merge probability in the opposite direction than expected.
